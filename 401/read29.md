# Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS


#### What is Next JS
- Vercel's Next.js is an open-source web development framework that creates static websites and allows server-side rendering for React-based online applications.

- A flexible React framework called Next.js gives you the tools you need to build quick web applications.

#### Building Blocks of a Web Application
- User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
- Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
- Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
- Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- Developer Experience - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.
- Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.

#### What is the DOM?
- The HTML elements are represented as objects by the DOM. It features a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships and serves as a link between your code and the user interface.

- You can select, add, update, and delete particular user interface elements using DOM methods and a programming language, like JavaScript, while also listening to user events. You can target particular items with DOM manipulation, as well as modify their style and content.

#### Tailwind CSS
- In order for Tailwind CSS to function, all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and other templates must have class names. If they do, then the program will create the relevant styles and write them to a static CSS file.

#### Why Tailwind CSS?
- Faster UI building process
- It is a utility-first CSS framework which means we can use utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS as in the traditional approach.

#### Advantages of Tailwind CSS:
- No more silly names for CSS classes and Id’s.
- We can customize the designs to make the components.
- Minimum lines of Code in CSS file.
- Makes the changes in the desired manner. 
- Makes the website responsive.
