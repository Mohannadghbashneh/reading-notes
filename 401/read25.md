# Graphs

## Reading:
#### What are graphs?
- A graph is a non-linear data structure that resembles a group of vertices (or nodes) that may be linked together by edges.

#### Terminology:
1. A vertex, often known as a "node," is a type of data item that can have zero or more nearby vertices.
2. An edge is a link that joins two nodes.
3. Neighbor: A node's neighbors are other nodes that are directly adjacent to it and connected to it by an edge.
4. The amount of edges that are connected to a vertex determines its degree.

#### Directed Graphs (Digraph)
- A graph with a directed edge pattern is referred to as a directed graph or a digraph.
- A Digraph has direction, in contrast to an undirected graph. Each node has a specific criterion for which node should be referenced next and is pointed at another node.

#### Undirected Graphs
- An undirected graph is one with undirected or bi-directional edges. As a result, there is no direction of movement for the undirected graph.

#### Acyclic vs Cyclic
1. A directed graph without cycles is known as an acyclic graph. A node enters a cycle when it may be travelled through and may eventually return to itself.

2. Cycle-containing graphs are known as cyclic graphs. A path with a positive length that begins and finishes at the same vertex is referred to as a cycle.

#### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
1. Complete Graphs
- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.]
2. Connected Graphs
- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
3. Disconnected Graphs
- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

#### Real World Uses of Graphs
1. GPS and Mapping
2. Driving Directions
3. Social Networks
4. Airline Traffic
5. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
