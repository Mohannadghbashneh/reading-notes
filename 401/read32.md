# Authentication
  - The process of confirming that someone or something is, in fact, who or what it claims to be is known as authentication. By comparing a user's credentials to those stored in a database of authorized users or on a data authentication server, authentication technology controls access to systems. Authentication ensures safe systems, secure business processes, and secure corporate data.

## Why is authentication important in cybersecurity?
  - Authentication enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users or processes to gain access to their protected resources. This may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.

## What is authentication used for?
 - User and process authentication are used to ensure that only authorized individuals or processes are allowed to access company IT resources. Depending on the use cases for which authentication is used, authentication can consist of either SFA, 2FA or MFA.
 
 
 # Authentication  Vs authorization
  - Authorization includes the process through which an administrator grants rights to authenticated users, as well as the process of checking user account permissions to verify that the user has been granted access to those resources. The privileges and preferences granted for an authorized account depend on the user's permissions, which are either stored locally or on an authentication server. The settings defined for all these environment variables are established by an administrator.
