# Jupyter Lab
**JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.**

# NumPy  
**Data Analysis with Python NumPy is a library for the Python programminglanguage, adding support for large,multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.**

* Why the use of Numpy?
you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn.

* How to use Numpy?
`import numpy as np`

**Numpy Arrays**

Numpy has many built-in functions and capabilities. We won't cover them all but instead we will focus on some of the most important aspects of Numpy: vectors,arrays,matrices, and number generation.

**Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays**

With NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays. A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix, and is something you should be familiar with. In fact, it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, we’re able to extract an element from a matrix.

**Creating A NumPy Array**

We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns. Because we want all of the elements in the array to be float elements for easy computation, we’ll leave off the header row, which contains strings. One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row, all the elements in the array will be read in as strings
