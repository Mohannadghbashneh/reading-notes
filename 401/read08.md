# Data Structure
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. 

**In computer science and computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of using it with various algorithms.**



### Why are data structures important?
Data structures are the building blocks for more sophisticated applications. They are designed by composing data elements into a logical unit representing an abstract data type that has relevance to the algorithm or application. An example of an abstract data type is a "customer name" that is composed of the character strings for "first name," "middle name" and "last name."

**It is not only important to use data structures, but it is also important to choose the proper data structure for each task. Choosing an ill-suited data structure could result in slow runtimes or unresponsive code.**

### Factors you must  consider when picking a data structure 
1. What kind of information will be stored?

2. How will that information be used?

3. Where should data persist, or be kept, after it is created?

4. What is the best way to organize the data?

5. What aspects of memory and storage reservation management should be considered?

### How are data structures used?
In general, data structures are used to implement the physical forms of abstract data types. Data structures are a crucial part of designing efficient software. They also play a critical role in algorithm design and how those algorithms are used within computer programs.

## Characteristics of data structures
1. Linear or non-linear.

2. Homogeneous or heterogeneous.

3. Static or dynamic.

# Linked List

**a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.**

### Important terms
1. Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

2. Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

3. LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

### Types of Linked List
1. Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

2. Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

3. Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

### Basic Operations
1. Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

2. Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

3. Display − Displays the complete list.

4. Search − Searches an element using the given key.

5. Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
