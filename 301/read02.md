# State and Props


### **1- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**

- the render

---
### **2- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**

- mounting phase by the constructor or something else.
---
### **3- Put the following things in the order that they happen:**
- componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

- constructor (at the first of mounting phase)
- render (also during mounting phase)
- componentDidMount (after finishing mounting phase)
- componentWillUnmount(finally if you removed the     component, unmounting phase.)

---
### **4- What does componentDidMount do?**
it is a method that will be invoked after finishing creating the component and mounting phase, you can call things you would see after the rendering process.

---


### **6- What types of things can you pass in the props?**
it is like arguments in the functions, it can pass numbers, texts, or anything else you want.

---

### **6- What is the big difference between props and state?**

- first difference: props pass into the component and it handled outside the component. but the state is handled inside the component itself.
- second difference: state used when you need to re-render your application after some data changing from the user. but props used when you need to display something in your application and you can’t update its value or re-render again without hard coding.

---

### **7- When do we re-render our application?**

- when the data of the component changes, it will be re-rendered directly. we can make our data changes by user action using states.

---

### **8- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**

- you can use state with forms to store the data from the user; like texts, numbers, checkboxes(true or false), and so on.
- also, you can use state with everything you want to change dynamically by user request; like a counter that changes every time for the same component.

### **Things I want to know more about**
- I would practice with state and props more and more to understand them correctly.
